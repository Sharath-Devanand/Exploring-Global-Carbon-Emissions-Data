# **Exploring-Global-Carbon-Emissions-Data**

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes global **carbon dioxide emissions** from fossil fuels and cement production, exploring trends across **income groups, countries, and economic indicators**. The analysis is conducted using **Python and Jupyter Notebooks**, leveraging **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn** for data processing and visualization.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset is sourced from **Our World in Data** and includes CO2 emissions data for various countries and regions from **1950 to 2021**. Key attributes include:  
- **Total emissions** by country and income group  
- **Per capita emissions**  
- **GDP per capita**  
- **Population size**  

## **Key Tasks & Visualizations**  

### **1. Growth of CO2 Emissions Over Time**  
- Analyzed total and per capita **CO2 emissions trends** from **1950 to 2021** across **four income groups**:  
  - **Low-income**  
  - **Lower-middle-income**  
  - **Upper-middle-income**  
  - **High-income**  
- Compared emissions contributions **in total vs. per capita terms** using **line plots**.  

### **2. Top CO2 Emitting Countries**  
- Identified the **top 5 countries** contributing to global emissions in **1960, 1990, and 2020**.  
- Created **side-by-side visualizations** showing:  
  - **Absolute CO2 emissions share**  
  - **Population-normalized CO2 emissions share**  
- Assessed how **leading emitters changed over time** and how **population-adjusted rankings differ**.  

### **3. Relationship Between GDP & CO2 Emissions**  
- Examined whether **higher GDP per capita** correlates with **higher CO2 emissions per capita**.  
- Used **bubble plots** (marker size proportional to population) for **1978, 1998, and 2018**.  
- Analyzed trends in **wealth vs. emissions intensity** across different economic periods.  

### **4. Wealth Distribution Over Time**  
- Investigated **global income inequality** from **1950 to 2020**.  
- Created **distribution plots** at **10-year intervals** to track changes in **GDP per capita distribution**.  
- Assessed whether global **wealth inequality** has increased or decreased over time.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**  
- **Data Cleaning & Processing**  
- **Statistical Analysis & Visualization**
